# Business Site

🏢 Build a Business Site
Your task is to create a business one-pager website that contains an image or video header and a signup form. The main focus is practising what you've learned about HTML forms. You can make up your own fantasy company or use an existing one.
- How you approached the task, what tools and techniques you used, and how you planned it
- If you had more time, what would be next?

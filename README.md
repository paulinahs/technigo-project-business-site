# 🏛️ Roman Tour Signup

A responsive business site designed for travelers to reserve their spot on a guided Roman tour.



## 📰 Brief description

This project was part of Technigo’s *Business Site* assignment, focused on creating a one-page website for a company or experience using **HTML forms** and **responsive design**.

My version, **Roman Tour Signup**, presents a clean and modern landing page for a fictional guided tour of Rome. The site includes a hero video showcasing the Colosseum and a detailed signup form that allows visitors to reserve their spot, choose their tour time, and specify interests.



## 🧭 Process & Approach

I started by planning the overall layout: a short hero section with video background to immediately set the atmosphere, followed by a centered signup card designed for ease of use and accessibility.

The signup form includes various input types — text, email, number, date, radio buttons, and checkboxes — to simulate a real booking experience. I kept the design minimal and focused on clarity, using white backgrounds, rounded corners, and soft shadows for a welcoming look.

Typography was kept simple with system fonts for readability, and the dark button provides a visual anchor against the light background.

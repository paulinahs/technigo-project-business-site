# Business Site

🏢 Build a Business Site
Your task is to create a business one-pager website that contains an image or video header and a signup form. The main focus is practising what you've learned about HTML forms. You can make up your own fantasy company or use an existing one.

If I had had more time I would have properly fleshed it out with wireframes and then prototype it before just putting something together.Still, I like what I did.
